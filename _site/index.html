        <p>It's not the emotion you experience that help form habits, but the competence and clarity you develop in performing the behavior. That sense of capability produces a feeling of success, which reinforces the desire to repeat it.</p>
        <p>Using analogies in explanation to make complex ideas more intelligible to reader can be misleading if they are taken as actual explanations, and they can distort the deeper truth. They often give the impression that we understand something when we don’t truly grasp its essence.</p>
        <p>What looks like random change is actually a tightly controlled process, shaped by internal preselection within its own system—not pre-fitted to external conditions, but emerging from complex internal order.</p>

    <p><blockquote>
  <p>The ideas, such as the circle and triangle, are not grasped with our senses; they are intelligible through our reason.
The particular circles and triangles that we perceive with our senses are like perishable representations of the corresponding ideas.
The ideas are universal and unchangeable, in contrast to the changeable representations.
The ideas are not something within our thoughts. They exist objectively; they are universally valid.</p>

  <p>If the universe is ‘divided into two’, that is, if there are two forms of existence - the things that we perceive with our senses and [[Plato’s theory of ideas|the ideas]] - then we have already prepared the ground for a universally valid ethics.
We have then, in a way, explained how it is possible to say that the good exists as something objective - that is , in the form of an idea.</p>
