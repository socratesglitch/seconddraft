        <p>Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.</p>

        <p>It's not the emotion you experience that help form habits, but the competence and clarity you develop in performing the behavior. That sense of capability produces a feeling of success, which reinforces the desire to repeat it.</p>
        <p>Using analogies in explanation to make complex ideas more intelligible to reader can be misleading if they are taken as actual explanations, and they can distort the deeper truth. They often give the impression that we understand something when we don’t truly grasp its essence.</p>
        <p>What looks like random change is actually a tightly controlled process, shaped by internal preselection within its own system—not pre-fitted to external conditions, but emerging from complex internal order.</p>
