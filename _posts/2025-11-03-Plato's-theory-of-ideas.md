> The ideas, such as the circle and triangle, are not grasped with our senses; they are intelligible through our reason.
> The particular circles and triangles that we perceive with our senses are like perishable representations of the corresponding ideas.
> The ideas are universal and unchangeable, in contrast to the changeable representations.
> The ideas are not something within our thoughts. They exist objectively; they are universally valid.
